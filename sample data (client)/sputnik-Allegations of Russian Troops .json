Russia has repeatedly stated that it is not involved in the conflict, calling it an internal matter, but has contributed to its peaceful resolution by acting as a mediator at talks in the Belarusian capital of Minsk that resulted in a ceasefire agreement between Kiev's forces and independence supporters of Ukraine's eastern regions.", "author": null, "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.com/images/101448/65/1014486552.jpg", "language": "en", "background": "255, 204, 204,1"}
