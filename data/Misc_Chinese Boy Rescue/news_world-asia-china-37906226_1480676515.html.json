The boy fell down the 40m dry well in Baoding, Hebei province on Sunday morning.\nHe had been helping harvest vegetables, his father told Chinese media. The child's condition is unknown.\nOxygen, food and water have been supplied. The 30cm-diameter well is too narrow for an adult to retrieve him.\nAfter two days of careful digging, rescuers have dug only 13m down the metal shaft, which threatens to collapse at any moment.\nAn 800-square metre work area has been cleared to facilitate rescue attempts, a volunteer told The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.\nThe well had been left unused for five years and there were no warning signs. Visual imagery has so far failed to locate the boy.\nMany locals volunteered to help in the rescue, rushing to the scene after learning about the accident on WeChat, a popular communication app in China.\nMost netizens sent good wishes to the boy.\n\"It was saddening to read about such news. As a mother, it was heartbreaking to see a child fall into a well.
