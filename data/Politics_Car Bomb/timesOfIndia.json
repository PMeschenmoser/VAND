The Sunni extremist group said it was targeting Shia Muslims.Iraqi officials said the bomb targeted car dealerships in the mostly Shia neighborhood.The extremist group has carried out near-daily attacks in Baghdad despite suffering military setbacks elsewhere in the country, including in the northern city of Mosul, where US-backed Iraqi forces have been waging a major operation since October.Another four attacks in and around Baghdad on Thursday killed eight people and wounded around 30, police and medical officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.A day earlier, a suicide bomber detonated a pick-up truck on Wednesday in Baghdad's Sadr City suburb, killing at least 15 and wounding 50 more.On Tuesday, a car bomb explosion in southern Baghdad killed at least four people.",
