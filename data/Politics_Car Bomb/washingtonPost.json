  "text": "At least 45 people were killed and dozens more \u00adinjured when a bomb detonated Thursday evening at a popular car market in southwestern Baghdad, the deadliest in a series of recent attacks in the Iraqi capital blamed on the Islamic State \u00admilitant group, the Interior \u00adMinistry said.\nA ministry spokesman said the bomb was placed in a parked car at the market in the Bayaa neighborhood, between Baghdad International Airport and the Tigris River. The Islamic State asserted responsibility in a brief statement circulated on social media.\nThe attack was at least the third bombing in the capital in as many days, and it appeared to be aimed at diverting the \u00adgovernment as it prepares an offensive to drive the Islamic State from the northern city of Mosul, the militants\u2019 last major stronghold in Iraq.\nThe Iraqi government has spent years and untold sums \u00adtrying to secure Baghdad, using checkpoints, blast walls and \u00adother measures, but militants have consistently found ways through, carrying out small-scale attacks with an alarming frequency and mass killings at regular intervals. In November, an explosion killed at least 70 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims, at a gas station south of Baghdad, in an attack claimed by the Islamic State.\n[A file on ISIS \u2018problem\u2019 foreign fighters shows some are refusing to fight ]\nBurnt vehicles at the scene of the blast. (Ahmad Mousa/AFP/Getty Images)\nMushtaq Talib, a 28-year-old dentist who lives about 2 1/2 miles from the car market, said the explosion shook his house. The market was crowded, as is typical on Thursdays and Fridays, with people visiting used-car shops and driving their own vehicles to the area, hoping for a sale.\nSoon after the explosion, Talib rushed to the scene, which he said had been secured by a single checkpoint before the attack, staffed by police officers.\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cDead bodies and body parts everywhere, they were all \u00adcivilians.\u201d\nCars not disabled by the blast were used to ferry the wounded to the hospital, as others waited for ambulances to arrive.\nVideos of the bombing that circulated on the Internet showed large-scale damage and terrible scenes: a line of white minibuses in flames, firefighters stumbling from one fire to the next and bodies everywhere, \u00addisfigured on the ground or \u00adbundled into a crude wheel\u00adbarrow with someone\u2019s arm dangling over the side.\n\u201cThese are the Iraqi people,\u201d a man, wailing, can be heard saying over and over in one of the video clips. In another video, a boy shouted that his father was lying under his food cart. It was not clear whether the man was alive.\nThe string of attacks comes as the militant group is trying to stave off defeat in Mosul. Iraqi military forces, backed by the United States, have secured the eastern party of the city and are expected to advance on western Mosul in the coming days. The remainder of the battle may turn out to be more grueling than its initial phase, which lasted nearly four months. Iraqi forces will be fighting in streets too narrow for armored vehicles to pass, in neighborhoods densely packed with civilians, against militants who may regard the fight for the strategic Iraqi city as a last stand.\nFahim reported from Istanbul.\nEastern side of Mosul recaptured from Islamic State, Iraqi prime minister says\nIraq has never seen this kind of fighting in its battles with ISIS\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",
