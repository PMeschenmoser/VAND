  "text": "Chris Cornell, the founder and frontman of the bands Soundgarden and Audioslave, died on May 17 in Detroit. He was a key figure in the '90s grunge rock movement. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\nChris Cornell, a key figure in the grunge rock movement as the co-founder and banshee-voiced frontman of Soundgarden, died Wednesday night in Detroit after playing a show with the Grammy-winning band. He was 52.\nBrian Bumbery, a publicist for Cornell, confirmed the singer\u2019s death to the Associated Press, calling it \u201csudden and unexpected.\u201d The cause of death was not immediately known, Bumbery said in a statement.\nCornell was in the middle of a national tour with Soundgarden, which was in the midst of writing and recording its first new album in five years. The band performed, as scheduled, Wednesday at Detroit\u2019s Fox Theatre.\n\u201cFinally back to Rock City!!!!\u201d Cornell tweeted just hours before his death.\nAlongside the likes of Nirvana, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains, Soundgarden was one of the seminal bands in the loosely defined grunge movement that roared out of the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s and ushered in a new era of rock.\nCo-founded in Seattle in 1984 by Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil and bassist Hiro Yamamoto, Soundgarden made loud and sludgy music that evoked the proto-heavy metal of the 1970s, though with a jagged punk edge. The band eventually became one of the first grunge acts to sign with a major label, but only after making several independent recordings \u2014 first with SubPop, the small Seattle record label that helped launch the culture-changing grunge movement.\nCornell played rhythm guitar but was best known for his throaty, multi-octave voice, which he once called \u201cunapologetically male.\u201d\n\u201cHe comes from the Robert Plant school of vocalists, more banshee wailing than guttural bellowing, and possesses a set of pipes that ensures his voice is the focal point of whatever he\u2019s singing, no matter what other musical mayhem may unfold,\u201d The Washington Post once wrote of Cornell.\nSoungarden\u2019s music resonated with listeners at a time when hair metal and New Wave competed for chart space. The band\u2019s songs were laden with emotion \u2014 and more often than not, that emotion was anger.\n\u201cFor me to make a connection with music it has to either have a visceral nature, whether it\u2019s anger or aggression or that kind of passion which shows up in rock music, or there has to be some sort of melancholy and introspection, something about it that makes you feel your own pain,\u201d Cornell told Rolling Stone.\nOf the band\u2019s sound, perhaps the heaviest in grunge, Cornell told the Guardian: \u201cIf you\u2019re an American kid, you can\u2019t help but be influenced by Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and the Rolling Stones because they\u2019re always on the radio. But from 17 to 19, all I listened to was Elvis Costello and the Beat. When Soundgarden formed we were post-punk \u2014 pretty quirky. Then somehow we found this neo-Sabbath psychedelic rock that fitted well with who we were.\u201d\nAs grunge became increasingly mainstream, Soundgarden\u2019s reach grew.\nThe group\u2019s major-label debut, 1991\u2019s \u201cBadmotorfinger,\u201d went multi-platinum and produced Soundgarden\u2019s first MTV and radio hit, \u201cRusty Cage,\u201d which Spin later called \u201cemblematic of grunge\u2019s rock-mutt DNA. It was punk spirit tempered with rock-star bravado, metal riffs forged with pop smarts.\u201d The magazine added that \u201cSoundgarden\u2019s sound was a raw, threatening ferocity that made radio metal seem immediately gauche, but played with arena-ready chops that could beat them at their own game \u2014 and you can hear both in frontman Chris Cornell\u2019s fire engine wail.\u201d\n#scary. I remember @chriscornell on tour with us so long ago. Remember drinking beer after the Melvins. Always thought we'd meet again RIP \u2014 Sebastian Bach (@sebastianbach) May 18, 2017\nSO SO stunned to hear about Chris Cornell! Such a terrible and sad loss! Thinking of his family tonight! RIP \u2014 Dave Navarro (@DaveNavarro) May 18, 2017\nThe band\u2019s next album, 1994\u2019s \u201cSuperunknown,\u201d topped the Billboard 200 charts and dominated rock radio, with hit single (\u201cSpoonman\u201d) after hit single (\u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d) after hit single (\u201cFell on Black Days\u201d). A follow-up album, \u201cDown on the Upside,\u201d peaked at No. 2 in 1996.\nSoundgarden went on hiatus the following year, though most fans assumed the group had broken up.\nIn a 2009 interview with The Washington Post, Cornell casually referenced \u201cthe split-up of Soundgarden.\u201d\n\u201cSo at some point, might we see a Soundgarden reunion?\u201d The Post then asked.\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d Cornell replied.\n\u201cEvery time I did an interview, I was asked, \u2018Is Soundgarden ever going to get back together? Will the band ever do anything again?\u2019\u201d Cornell told Gibson.com in 2011.\nIndeed, it would.\nThe band returned at the end of 2012 with the well-received \u201cKing Animal.\u201d Its fans were still around and hungry for new music, it seemed, as the album reached No. 5 on the big Billboard chart.\nWith Soundgarden on hiatus, Cornell founded the rock supergroup Audioslave with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, three members of Rage Against the Machine. That band eventually broke up but reunited in January to play a Southern California concert in protest of President Trump.\nCornell\u2019s beginnings were a little more humble than his success might suggest.\n\u201cI was going to be a musician, no matter what it took,\u201d he told ESPN. \u201cI supported myself with blue-collared jobs so I could write music and be in a band and play shows.\u201d\nAnd musician he was, but he found himself playing in a cover band called the Shemps when he was 18. He wanted to write and perform his own music, as he recalled to Richmond\u2019s Style Weekly.\n\u201cI was driving home from a restaurant gig thinking: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s hugely successful, it matters that we get to create our own songs and art. I don\u2019t care if I have to break concrete if that supports the art,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to play Police covers in the back of a Chinese restaurant, that\u2019s not me. \u2026 Something felt really settled in me when I thought that.\u201d\nWith Soundgarden, Cornell found creative satisfaction \u2014 and, eventually, fame.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t a band that had overnight success, it came slowly and with a lot of effort,\u201d he told Style Weekly.\n\u201cThe thing that was amazing about Soundgarden is that they were just so natural; it was just like this effortlessness to the whole thing,\u201d SubPop co-founder Jonathan Poneman once told an interviewer. \u201cThere was this unholy mixture of Black Sabbath and the Butthole Surfers, which at the time was totally revolutionary. \u2026 There was some [Led] Zeppelin thrown in there, and there was more than a little Black Flag thrown in there, particularly in Kim\u2019s guitar playing.\u201d\nThe fame Cornell\u2019s music brought came with a steep price. He spent time in rehab for \u201cvarious things,\u201d but \u201cmainly for drinking,\u201d he told Spin. According to Cornell, it was a way of escaping his fame, which he found isolating.\n\u201cI\u2019m Irish: If I could get the cap off something, I would drink it. And drinking was really an extension of becoming isolated from all my other relationships,\u201d he told the magazine, remembering the first time he was recognized \u201cat four in the morning, in the middle of Mississippi\u201d after the music video for his song \u201cOutshined\u201d played on MTV for the first time.\nAfter that, he tried avoiding the public. Drinking made that easy.\n\u201cI never liked being recognized to begin with, and I was never much of a social person, so this gave me a chance to play the \u2018I don\u2019t want to go out\u2019 card,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just stay in and drink.\u201d\n\u201cI could drink a lot, and I tended to have violent outbursts,\u201d he added.\nIn 2002, he \u201chad to come to the conclusion, the sort of humbling conclusion that, guess what, I\u2019m no different than anybody else, I\u2019ve got to sort of ask for help \u2014 not something I ever did, ever, as he told Blabbermouth, so he checked himself into rehab.\n\u201cI actually like rehab a lot,\u201d he told Spin. \u201cIt\u2019s like school; it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m learning that I can be teachable at age 38.\u201d\nMan. Gone too soon. Rest in power chris Cornell. One of my favorite songs right here.
