  "text": "Veteran law enforcement officials praised the selection on Wednesday, calling Mr. Mueller someone widely respected by members of both parties as an unflinching advocate for facts.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cBest possible selection they could have made. Truly independent, nonpartisan and certainly knows how to investigate,\u201d said Timothy Murphy, who retired as F.B.I. deputy director in 2011. \u201cNo one stands as tall.\u201d\nMr. Mueller, 72, was born in New York and attended Princeton University before earning a master\u2019s degree in international relations from New York University. He led a rifle platoon in Vietnam before receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia and becoming a federal prosecutor in San Francisco and Boston. He supervised cases like the prosecution of the crime boss John J. Gotti and the investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe picture of an old-fashioned G-man, Mr. Mueller, a onetime ice hockey player, rose through the F.B.I.\u2019s ranks to become director just a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which forced him to transform the bureau from a crime-fighting organization into a central piece of the antiterrorism establishment.\nPhoto\nIn doing so, he sought to avoid the chopping up of the bureau by embracing a new mission even as he repeatedly refused to abandon his law-enforcement roots. Just days after the attacks, he clashed with other Bush administration officials whom he viewed as too willing to abandon prosecutorial protections and procedures.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nEven so, Mr. Mueller survived the bureaucratic and political maelstrom in Washington, serving out his 10-year term before Mr. Obama asked him to stay on for three more years. That required an act of Congress, which was approved in 2011.\nMr. Mueller nurtured bipartisan support throughout his career by carefully cultivating an above-the-fray posture, often trying to stay out of politically charged disputes.\n\u201cSmart, tough and persistent but fair,\u201d Fran Townsend, Mr. Bush\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, said on Wednesday. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said he now has \u201csignificantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts.\u201d\nAn intensely private figure who has largely vanished from public view since his retirement, Mr. Mueller has often pined for the days when he worked to prevent run-of-the-mill crimes.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The story involves a surveillance operation, with agents tailing a suspect in a car. Mr. Mueller is known to ask all the predictable questions about the suspect, and then pounce with \u201cWhat color is the car?\u201d\nIn some tellings, the briefer responds, \u201cRed,\u201d only to be asked, \u201cWhat shade?\u201d",
