  "text": "In a statement, the White House denied the version of events in the memo.\n\u201cWhile the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.\u201d\nMr. Chaffetz\u2019s letter, sent to the acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, set a May 24 deadline for the internal documents to be delivered to the House committee. The congressman, a Republican, was criticized in recent months for showing little of the appetite he demonstrated in pursuing Hillary Clinton to pursue investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBut since announcing in April that he will not seek re-election in 2018, Mr. Chaffetz has shown more interest in the Russia investigation, and held out the potential for a subpoena on Tuesday, a notably aggressive move as most Republicans have tried to stay out of the fray.\nIn testimony to the Senate last week, Mr. McCabe said, \u201cThere has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.\u201d Mr. McCabe was referring to the broad investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The investigation into Mr. Flynn is separate.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nA spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment.\nMr. Comey created similar memos \u2014 including some that are classified \u2014 about every phone call and meeting he had with the president, the two people said. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey told the Justice Department about the conversation or his memos.\nThe Day\u2019s Top Political News\nMr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last week. Trump administration officials have provided multiple, conflicting accounts of the reasoning behind Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that one of the reasons was because he believed \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d was a \u201cmade-up story.\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Feb. 14 meeting took place just a day after Mr. Flynn was forced out of his job after it was revealed he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Get the latest on President Trump and James Comey \u2014 and other major news \u2014 delivered to your email inbox.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nDespite the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey, the investigation of Mr. Flynn has proceeded. In Virginia, a federal grand jury has issued subpoenas in recent weeks for records related to Mr. Flynn. Part of the Flynn investigation is centered on his financial links to Russia and Turkey.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Comey had been in the Oval Office that day with other senior national security officials for a terrorism threat briefing. When the meeting ended, Mr. Trump told those present \u2014 including Mr. Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 to leave the room except for Mr. Comey.\nAlone in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump began the discussion by condemning leaks to the news media, saying that Mr. Comey should consider putting reporters in prison for publishing classified information, according to one of Mr. Comey\u2019s associates.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Trump then turned the discussion to Mr. Flynn.\nAfter writing up a memo that outlined the meeting, Mr. Comey shared it with senior F.B.I. officials. Mr. Comey and his aides perceived Mr. Trump\u2019s comments as an effort to influence the investigation, but they decided that they would try to keep the conversation secret \u2014 even from the F.B.I. agents working on the Russia investigation \u2014 so the details of the conversation would not affect the investigation.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Comey was known among his closest advisers to document conversations that he believed would later be called into question, according to two former confidants, who said Mr. Comey was uncomfortable at times with his relationship with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Comey\u2019s recollection has been bolstered in the past by F.B.I. notes. In 2007, he told Congress about a now-famous showdown with senior White House officials over the Bush administration\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program. The White House disputed Mr. Comey\u2019s account, but the F.B.I. director at the time, Robert S. Mueller III, kept notes that backed up Mr. Comey\u2019s story.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe White House has repeatedly crossed lines that other administrations have been reluctant to cross when discussing politically charged criminal investigations. Mr. Trump has disparaged the continuing F.B.I. investigation as a hoax and called for an inquiry into his political rivals. His representatives have taken the unusual step of declaring no need for a special prosecutor to investigate the president\u2019s associates.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Oval Office meeting occurred a little over two weeks after Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Comey to the White House for a lengthy, one-on-one dinner at the residence. At that dinner, on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey at least two times for a pledge of loyalty \u2014 which Mr. Comey declined, according to one of Mr. Comey\u2019s associates.\nIn a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Comey\u2019s associates did not believe there was any way to corroborate Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. But Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion last week that he was keeping tapes has made them wonder whether there are tapes that back up Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe Jan. 27 dinner came a day after White House officials learned that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. On Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House counsel about the interview, and said Mr. Flynn could be subject to blackmail by the Russians because they knew he had lied about the content of the calls.",
