  "text": "A recent poll put Mr. Raisi in second place in the race for the presidency, with 27 percent of the projected vote. The same poll, by the Iranian Students Polling Agency, projected that the incumbent president, Hassan Rouhani, will get around 42 percent, depending on the turnout on Friday.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOn Monday, though, the second-most-popular conservative in the race, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, suspended his campaign and threw his support to Mr. Raisi, possibly raising what analysts say are his chances of pulling off an upset.\nWhile Mr. Ghalibaf is nominally a conservative, he bases his appeal on his management skills, not ideology, so it is unclear how much, if at all, he might actually help Mr. Raisi.\nIn 1979, the impoverished and religious masses from what was then a vast rural population were the driving force behind the revolution. Iran today is far more urban and educated, but the split endures. Mr. Raisi is calculating that by pounding away at the themes of inequality and corruption he can reap enough votes from the declining provincial sector to propel him to victory.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMany of those voters, who strongly believe in the Islamic Republic\u2019s anti-Western ideology or feel strangled by poverty, hail Mr. Raisi as a savior, ready to set Iran back on the right course.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAt the same time, Mr. Raisi has refrained from raising any of the social issues his faction usually cares so much about, such as Islamic dress codes and segregation of men and women, as they might put off potential voters.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nHis critics see him as a hypocrite, a consummate insider who has suddenly adopted the stance of a populist outsider and corruption fighter. \u201cMr. Raisi misuses religion and makes empty promises,\u201d said Hossein Ghayyoumi, a reformist cleric who supports Mr. Rouhani. \u201cWhy has he not fought corruption within the judiciary, where he has been for the past 38 years?\u201d\nHe also has a dark episode in his past as a judiciary official, accused of involvement in the mass execution of political opponents in 1988 \u2014 something that Mr. Rouhani is not shy about mentioning.\nMr. Raisi and Mr. Rouhani are both Shiite Muslim clerics and staunch defenders of the idea of an Islamic Republic ruled by clerics, with some direct elections. But the similarities end there. To a surprising extent, their differences mirror those in Europe and the United States: the establishment versus populism, globalists versus nationalists.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Rouhani is the globalist, seeing the way forward in outreach to other countries and foreign investment to reinvigorate the ailing economy. A critical element in that strategy was the completion of the nuclear agreement with the United States and other world powers, which the president sold as an essential first step. It has not worked out that way, however, as existing, unilateral United States sanctions have hindered foreign investment and banking.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nSensing Mr. Rouhani\u2019s vulnerability, Mr. Raisi as nationalist has criticized the pact, saying on Wednesday, \u201cWhere in the world does a government weaken its defensive potentials, missiles for preventing wars?\u201d\nHe says the solutions for Iran\u2019s problems must be found \u201cinside the country\u201d and asserts that one of the main reasons Iran is stable and secure is its military support for Shiite fighters in Iraq and Syria.\n\u201cThe only attitude to solve problems is a revolutionary spirit,\u201d Mr. Raisi said in an interview with state television. He has promised to create millions of jobs using what he likes to call \u201cjihadi management,\u201d and to increase monthly cash handouts for the poor.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\u201cHe will bring the economists and experts who have been neglected in past years and fix things,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Raisi\u2019s campaign has been quick to pick up on new opportunities offered by social media, now available in Iran. He regularly posts on Instagram and has channels on Telegram, where his campaign spreads video clips of him speaking or meeting personalities.\nVideo\nHowever, liberal economists dismiss Mr. Raisi\u2019s ideas as fanciful and dangerous. \u201cHis economic and social policies are like those from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: disastrous,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to President Rouhani. \u201cWhat foreign company will invest in Iran if he becomes president?\u201d\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Raisi enjoys the support of many in Iran\u2019s security forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps and the members of the paramilitary basij forces. He also appears to have the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, who like Mr. Raisi is a staunch guardian of the country\u2019s anti-Western ideology.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn a recent speech he criticized the government\u2019s signing of a Unesco agreement on education and the equal rights of men and women, which he said was contrary to Iran\u2019s cultural values. \u201cWhy have they signed this?\u201d he asked publicly.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nAyatollah Khamenei has also criticized the liberal economic policies of the Rouhani government, stressing that Iran must be self-sufficient and embrace what he calls the \u201cresistance economy,\u201d which presumably is not that different from Mr. Raisi\u2019s \u201cjihadi management.\u201d\nNevertheless, Ayatollah Khamenei is also a pragmatist who has signed off on important decisions \u2014 like negotiating directly with the great Satan, the United States, in brokering the nuclear agreement \u2014 that contradict some of the Islamic Republic\u2019s longstanding political views. After the deal was completed, Iran opened up further politically by inviting European and Asian leaders long shunned by hard-liners.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMoreover, in Iran presidents typically serve two terms. Mr. Khamenei is generally not one to break with tradition, so while anything can happen in the voting, he may be comfortable with a second term for Mr. Rouhani, especially after a bruising fight that leaves the president weakened.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nBut Mr. Raisi is not to be lightly dismissed. Believed by adherents to be a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, he is currently the custodian of the Shrine of Imam Reza, the wealthiest religious endowment in the Middle East.\nPhoto\nHe was born and raised in the eastern city of Mashhad, the son of a cleric, and joined the revolution at a young age. During those turbulent days, the 20-year-old was propelled into a series of sensitive positions, serving as a prosecutor in several cities and trained by Ayatollah Khamenei as a promising young bureaucrat. In 1985, he became the deputy prosecutor of Tehran.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIt was in that position that Mr. Raisi was implicated in one of the bloodiest episodes in the history of the Islamic Republic. He and three others, including the current minister of justice, Mustafa Pourmohammadi, sat on a committee that sent thousands of political prisoners to their deaths.\nMr. Raisi has not commented specifically on the event, but has said that as a prosecutor he \u201cnever sent anyone to their deaths.\u201d\nHe is married to the daughter of the hard-line Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, Ahmad Alamolhoda, who recently led a successful fight against pop concerts there, saying they do not befit a holy city.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn a campaign video Mr. Raisi elaborated on the controversy, saying, \u201cI remember when there was such a hype over the concerts, I told my friends, the government should think up a solution for the concerts of poor people, the concerts of slum-dwellers, and the concerts of salaries below 1 million toman,\u201d about $250. The government should listen to the complaints of the poor, Mr. Raisi said, before worrying about pop concerts.\nAs the head of the Astan Quds Razavi, the religious foundation, Mr. Raisi potentially has access to billions of dollars, a fact that Mr. Rouhani has raised repeatedly in recent attacks.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn his campaign video, however, Mr. Raisi played down the power of the institution.\n\u201cRight now I am in charge of a very small foundation,\u201d he intoned. \u201cJust imagine what we could achieve if it was at the national level.\u201d",
