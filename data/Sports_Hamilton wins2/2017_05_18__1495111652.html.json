  "text": "Republicans may be reluctant to fully take on President Donald Trump, but that doesn\u2019t mean the scandal involving his presidential campaign\u2019s contacts with individuals connected to the Russian government will simply go away.\nAt least 18 calls and emails took place between Russians and members of the Trump campaign between April and November 2016, according to a new report by Reuters. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who was forced to resign in February after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, was among the Trump campaign members who corresponded with Russians during this period. Of the 18 communications, six of them were phone calls between Kislyak and Trump advisers (including Flynn).",
