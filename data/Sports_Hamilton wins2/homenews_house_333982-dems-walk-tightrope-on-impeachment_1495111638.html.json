  "text": "Democratic leaders have a message for those members of their caucus beating the drum to impeach President Trump: not so fast.\n\u201cI would suggest \u2026 there needs to be a full investigation first,\u201d Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Wednesday. \u201cWe need to get to the facts, and let the facts lead where they may.\u201d\nIn the eyes of several Democrats, however, the facts already lead to impeachment.\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday night announced it was naming a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 presidential election, a response to longstanding calls from Democrats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFormer FBI Director Robert Mueller, a former prosecutor who served a 12-year term at the helm of the bureau, was named to the position by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.\nBefore that news broke, Democrats took steps Wednesday to express their case for impeachment following new reports suggesting Trump tried to block an FBI probe into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) spoke out at a closed-door House Democratic Caucus meeting Wednesday morning to highlight the urgency of removing Trump, whom the Democrats increasingly see as a national security liability.\nAlmost simultaneously, Rep. Al Green Al GreenDems walk tightrope on impeachment Overnight Defense: Justice Department appoints special counsel for Russia probe | Fallout from Comey memo continues | Trump admin renews Iran sanctions relief McCain: Talk of impeaching Trump not \u2018rational\u2019 MORE (D-Texas) took to the House floor to trumpet the impeachment call he\u2019d sounded earlier in the week. He characterized his decision as a \u201cposition of conscience.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a belief in this country that no one is above the law, and that includes the president,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis is where I stand; I will not be moved.\u201d\nThe impeachment debate is forcing Democratic leaders to walk a fine line in their approach to the ongoing Russia-Trump saga. On one hand, the Democrats want to keep the pressure on the White House and tap the energy the remarkable story is generating among members of their base, many of whom support the impeachment route. On the other, they don\u2019t want to politicize their calls for an independent investigation.\n\u201cWe have to be circumspect as we look at this tale of horrors,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.). \u201cBecause we should not give the impression that we are obsessed with removing Donald Trump Donald TrumpThe Democrats can be great again, here\u2019s how The Memo: GOP talk of impeachment highlights Trump\u2019s troubles Sherrod Brown looks to defy Trump trend in Ohio MORE from office \u2014 it will only harden his supporters.\n\u201cBased on what I\u2019ve read and heard, Mr. Trump is in trouble, and he doesn\u2019t need any help to get into deeper trouble.\u201d\nTop Democratic leaders insist they\u2019re not putting any pressure on their troops to shy away from impeachment calls.\n\u201cMembers can come to their own conclusions, and we don\u2019t pretend to stand here and speak on behalf of every single individual member of our caucus,\u201d Crowley said.\nBut leaders are also making clear they don\u2019t support impeachment.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) this week downplayed any impeachment calls as \u201ca reflection\u201d of what a few lawmakers \u201care hearing in their own constituencies.\u201d\n\u201cThey know I don\u2019t subscribe to that,\u201d she said during a CNN town hall event.\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the Democratic whip, said Tuesday that any talk of impeachment is premature.\n\u201cWe need to get the facts first.\u201d\nAnd during Wednesday\u2019s caucus meeting, Rep. Adam Schiff Adam SchiffDems walk tightrope on impeachment Intel panels: House, Senate Russia probes to proceed Special prosecutor appointment gets bipartisan praise MORE (Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, addressed the group in an effort to discourage the impeachment push.\n\u201cWe ought to keep our focus on finding out the facts in the first instance. And no one ought to, in my view, rush to embrace the most extraordinary remedy that involves the removal of the president from office,\u201d Schiff told reporters afterward.\n\u201cIt cannot be perceived as an effort to nullify the election by other means.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Democratic leaders have tamped down the efforts of angry caucus members seeking to impeach a Republican president. In 2006, several Democrats, including veteran Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), launched a bid to impeach then-President George W. Bush over his handling of the Iraq War and the administration\u2019s warrantless surveillance programs.\nPelosi, who was then, as now, minority leader, quashed that effort out of concern that Republicans would use it on the campaign trail to energize GOP voters with warnings that Bush would be imperiled if the Democrats won the Speaker\u2019s gavel. She did, and no impeachment process followed.\nStill, Green said Wednesday that, while he hasn\u2019t introduced the articles of impeachment that would start the process, \u201cI will do that if it is not done by others.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say when.\nBefore the Mueller announcement, Democratic leaders were pressing ahead with their investigative strategy. On Wednesday, they unveiled a discharge petition on legislation creating an independent, outside panel \u2014 similar to the 9/11 Commission \u2014 to take the lead in the Russia investigation.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), a lead sponsor of the bill, said such a panel might dig up information that eventually leads to impeachment proceedings, though Democrats need to be patient and take the process one step at a time.\n\u201cI just want to get the information,\u201d he said. \u201cWill it lead to impeachment? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no denying, however, that more and more Democrats are mentioning impeachment since Trump\u2019s decision last week to fire former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading a probe into Russia\u2019s ties to the White House. And Tuesday\u2019s New York Times report saying Trump pressed Comey to drop the Flynn probe seems to have accelerated the trend.\n\u201cWe are rapidly approaching an impeachment process,\u201d Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said Wednesday.\nRep. John Yarmuth John YarmuthDems walk tightrope on impeachment House Budget chair to push for Medicaid changes Pelosi: New ObamaCare repeal bill is a \u2018a very sad, deadly joke\u2019 MORE (D-Ky.) said this week\u2019s revelation of the Comey memo \u201cwas a game-changer.\u201d\nAnd Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said he is getting closer to supporting impeachment with each new development.\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming very, very close,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cThe drip-drip just cannot continue,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to save the country.\u201d",
