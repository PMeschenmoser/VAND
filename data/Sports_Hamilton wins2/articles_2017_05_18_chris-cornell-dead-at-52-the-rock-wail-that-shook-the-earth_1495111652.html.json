  "text": "His wail, a four-octave fusillade of shrieks dripping with sex, recalled Robert Plant on two packs a day. But Chris Cornell\u2019s unmistakable voice fell silent on Wednesday night, as the singer died suddenly\u2014and under mysterious circumstances\u2014mere hours after performing a show in Detroit. He was 52 years old.\nJust eight hours before his passing was announced, the lead singer of the veteran Seattle rock outfit Soundgarden posted an excited comment to Twitter looking forward to his band\u2019s gig that evening.\nIn a statement provided to media this morning, a rep for the band said Cornell died in Detroit, Michigan, on Wednesday night, and that his death was \u201csudden and unexpected.\u201d\n\u201cChris Cornell passed away late last night in Detroit, MI. His wife Vicky and family were shocked to learn of his sudden and unexpected passing, and they will be working closely with the medical examiner to determine the cause,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThey would like to thank his fans for their continuous love and loyalty and ask that their privacy be respected at this time.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Cornell had posted an emotional tribute to his second wife to mark Mother\u2019s Day:\nOne of the last great surviving grunge vocalists, Cornell was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1964, and it was there that the hard rock quartet Soundgarden was formed in 1984. Their third album, 1991\u2019s million-selling Badmotorfinger, established the group as a force to be reckoned with in the west coast rock scene, earning the group a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. But it was their fourth album, Superunknown, that propelled the group to rock stardom. On the back of hit singles \u201cSpoonman,\u201d \u201cMy Wave,\u201d \u201cFell on Black Days,\u201d and \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d\u2014the latter tune taking home an MTV Award for its surreal, eye-popping music video\u2014the album sold 9 million copies, taking home two Grammys along the way.\nCornell\u2019s impact on the \u201880s and \u201890s grunge scene was enormous, as Soundgarden\u2019s fusion of Zeppelin and punk delivered a shot of adrenaline into a moribund rock scene left decimated by hair metal. Kurt Cobain would later credit Soundgarden as the main reason Nirvana signed to their first label, Sub Pop. Soundgarden would, along with Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, cameo in Cameron Crowe\u2019s 1992 film Singles, chronicling intertwining love stories in Seattle\u2019s grunge scene.\nThat wasn\u2019t Cornell\u2019s only connection to Pearl Jam. In 1990, following the loss of his friend and former roommate Andrew Wood to heroin, Cornell approached Wood\u2019s bandmates in Mother Love Bone, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, about recording a tribute song. The gang eventually recorded an entire album, and named the project Temple of the Dog\u2014taken from the Mother Love Bone song \u201cMan of Golden Words.\u201d Vedder would provide guest vocals on Temple of the Dog\u2019s hit song \u201cHunger Strike,\u201d and following the release of the self-titled album in 1991, Vedder, Ament, and Gossard would break off to form Pearl Jam.\nSoundgarden, meanwhile, broke up in 1997. But by 2001, Cornell had joined the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine\u2014following the departure of singer Zack de la Rocha\u2014in creating a new group: Audioslave. Exhibiting a more restrained, melancholic sound from Soundgarden and Rage, the group would go on to release several platinum-selling albums, spawning the radio hits \u201cBe Yourself,\u201d \u201cLike a Stone,\u201d and \u201cCochise,\u201d with Cornell serving as singer and lyricist. The group broke up acrimoniously in 2007, only to reunite for a performance on January 20th of this year at Prophets of Rage\u2019s Anti-Inaugural Ball\u2014protesting the inauguration of President Donald Trump.\nIn addition to Soundgarden and Audioslave, Cornell released a trio of albums as a solo artist and co-wrote and performed the song \u201cYou Know My Name,\u201d which served as the theme song to the 2006 James Bond blockbuster Casino Royale. Cornell also contributed songs to the soundtracks of Great Expectations and Mission: Impossible 2.\nHe was a rock god in every sense, with his distinctive shoulder-length tresses, toned torso, and piercing blue eyes. But like many of his grunge contemporaries, including the late Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, the late Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley, and Cobain, who committed suicide in 1994, Cornell was plagued by drug and alcohol abuse.\n\u201cWe were all selling drugs by the time we were 12, or doing them,\u201d he once said. \u201cPot or pills or anything that was easily available.\u201d\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

He eventually sobered up by 2006.\n\u201cIt was a long period of coming to the realization that this way (sober) is better,\u201d said Cornell. \u201cGoing through rehab, honestly, did help...it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them. They give you such a simple message, that any idiot can get\u2026 you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you.\u201d\nFollowing Audioslave\u2019s split, Cornell reunited with his Soundgarden bandmates in 2010 for a series of live shows, later accompanied by 2012\u2019s King Animal\u2014their first studio album in 16 years. The group stayed intact and toured up until his death.\nLast year, Cornell opened up to 105.7 The Point radio station about the deaths of fellow grunge icons Weiland, Staley, and Cobain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of a history of sort of\u2026 not deifying, but glamorizing a little bit the \u2018dead guy,\u2019 whether it\u2019s a rock star or a famous actor. Like James Dean, he only made three movies, and he\u2019s one of the best-known actors of all time,\u201d said Cornell. \u201cAnd granted, I think everyone agreed that he was really talented. And he died in a sort of glamorous badass way, which was in a little race car on his way to a race, driving it himself. I think there\u2019s something to the legend of that, and something to the story of that.\u201d\nIt is not known as of yet how Cornell died, but in the annals of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, it is all but guaranteed that he will go down a legend.\nCornell leaves behind his wife, Vicky, and three children.",
