  "text": "The AP, NPR, and other news outlets are reporting this morning that Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave died last night after playing a Soundgarden show at the Fox Theatre in Detroit. The BBC called him \u201cthe architect of grunge.\u201d In a statement to CNN this morning, his representative Brian Bumbery said: \u201cHis wife Vicky and family were shocked to learn of his sudden and unexpected passing, and they will be working closely with the medical examiner to determine the cause. They would like to thank his fans for their continuous love and loyalty and ask that their privacy be respected at this time.\u201d Meanwhile, WXYZ Detroit is reporting that police say Cornell died of a possible suicide. He was 52.\nAlong with Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains, Cornell\u2019s band Soundgarden was one of the cornerstones of the \u201990s Seattle grunge movement. The band was also one of the first grunge bands to sign with a major label. Cornell\u2019s distinctive four-octave voice helped push Soundgarden albums like 1994\u2019s Superunknown\u2014which also won Grammys for \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d and \u201cSpoonman\u201d\u2014to the top of the Billboard 100.\nSoundgarden disbanded in 1997 before reuniting in 2010, and Cornell formed Audioslave with former members of Rage Against The Machine in 2001. Cornell also released five solo albums, and was nominated for a Grammy for the theme song to the James Bond movie Casino Royale, \u201cYou Know My Name.\u201d\nThe tour Cornell was currently on with Soundgarden was set to wrap up in Oklahoma on May 27. Before that tour, Cornell tweeted, \u201cWhat I look forward to the most\u2026 is the camaraderie. It\u2019s what we missed when we weren\u2019t a band.\u201d When the news broke before dawn in the U.S. this morning, tributes started pouring in on Twitter:\nRIP Chris Cornell\nIncredibly Talented\nIncredibly Young\nIncredibly Missed. pic.twitter.com/pKNI4tKiXz \u2014 Jimmy Page (@JimmyPage) May 18, 2017\nA mutual friend called me and tells me my bro passed away. #RIPChrisCornell You are a great artist Love to Vicki and fam @nilerodgers pic.twitter.com/FhG0fhT0q1 \u2014 Nile Rodgers (@nilerodgers) May 18, 2017\nSO SO stunned to hear about Chris Cornell!
