  "text": "The Post's Adam Entous discusses a 2016 conversation between GOP leaders in which House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) made an explosive claim about Donald Trump. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\nRep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s Republican colleagues were ready Wednesday to accept the House majority leader\u2019s explanation that he was joking in his private comments last year suggesting that then-candidate Donald Trump was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cIt was a bad attempt at a joke,\u201d McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters Wednesday evening, moments after The Washington Post published an account of the remark based on a recording of a June 2016 meeting of GOP leaders. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it. Nobody believes it to be true.\u201d\nAmong those willing to give the Californian a pass was another GOP figure whom McCarthy identified as possibly being on Putin\u2019s payroll: Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.).\nMcCarthy found Rohrabacher on the House floor Wednesday evening and assured him the remark captured on the recording obtained by the Post \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,\u201d McCarthy said \u2014 was not to be taken seriously.\nRohrabacher agreed and compared the situation to a lunge at humor that had haunted him for years.\n\u201cYou have to be very careful when you\u2019re using humor,\u201d Rohrabacher said in a short interview Wednesday evening. \u201cI remember that I was trying to make fun of the scientists who claimed that cow flatulence make global warming. So at a hearing, I said, \u2018Oh, do you think the dinosaurs disappeared because of dinosaur flatulence?\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cTo this day, you have these environmental wackos saying \u2018Dana Rohrabacher believes that flatulence killed the dinosaurs,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cIt was humor, but you\u2019ve got to watch out for it. Kevin didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d\nThe meeting included House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who swore its attendees to secrecy by saying they were all \u201cfamily\u201d and should not leak the contents of the discussion.\nTwo of the GOP leaders who were in the room with McCarthy last June said Wednesday they did not recall the majority leader\u2019s remark.\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll review my notes,\u201d said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), the chief deputy whip.\n\u201cI never heard him say that,\u201d House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) told reporters.\nOther Republicans, meanwhile, flatly dismissed McCarthy\u2019s comment as misunderstood humor.\n\u201cIt had to be a joke,\u201d said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.). \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d say something like that seriously. I wouldn\u2019t put any credibility in that statement being what he actually thinks.\u201d\nSaid Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), a close friend of McCarthy\u2019s, explained, \u201cWith Kevin, he does have a sense of humor, and so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me for him to joke about. This one I can\u2019t comment on. But we joke with each other all day long.\u201d\nOne GOP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, was skeptical that McCarthy would have any special knowledge of Putin\u2019s activities.\n\u201cThere is no way Kevin McCarthy had that kind of intel up here on the Hill,\u201d the member said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke.\u201d\nSome Democrats, however, had a different reaction.\n\u201cI want to hear the recording,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who has called for a more vigorous probe of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201cWhat\u2019s concerning to me is, if it was said, had their own concerns, and so far have done nothing to address concerns about the president\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d\n\u201cDid he have knowledge of a relationship that the president had with Russia, and did he pass that along to anyone? And if he did have knowledge, why have we not acted?\u201d Swalwell asked of McCarthy. \u201cWe have a responsibility as a coequal branch of government to investigate this.\u201d\nA spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also noted the disconnect between McCarthy\u2019s comment and the GOP\u2019s public posture at the time he made it.\n\u201cFor weeks last summer, Russia\u2019s hacking of our democratic institutions yielded only silence from these Republican leaders,\u201d said the spokesman, Drew Hammill. \u201cApparently, Leader McCarthy could only be bothered to speak out from the comforts of a private backroom in the Capitol.\u201d\nBut other Democrats didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the report.\n\u201cThat one has to sink in for a while,\u201d said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), another member of the intelligence panel.\n\u201cWe almost made it through a day without a major breaking story,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.). \u201cBut, no, we\u2019re not making it to cocktail hour.\u201d\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said it \u201cfits in the category of surreal.\u201d\n\u201cBut probably the most surreal is the fact that you have Vladimir Putin vouching for the president of the United States about something that took place in the Oval Office,\u201d he added, referring to Putin\u2019s Wednesday offer to release \u201crecords\u201d of his envoys\u2019 meeting with Trump last week.\nRohrabacher made his joke about dinosaur flatulence 10 years ago, during a hearing on climate change that took place shortly after Democrats won back the House. A climate-change skeptic, Rohrabacher asked a group of scientists if they could really, with confidence, say why atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were higher in the Paleocene-Eocene era.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what those other cycles were caused by in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cCould be dinosaur flatulence, you know, or who knows? We do know the CO2 in the past had its time when it was greater as well.\u201d\nSince then, Rohrabacher has been reelected easily. But in 2016, for the first time, his district voted for the Democrats\u2019 presidential candidate, picking Hillary Clinton over President Trump by 1.7 points. Democrats have for the first time worked hard to recruit a credible challenger, and the climate story has been part of their argument.\nThat challenger, businessman Harley Rouda, issued a statement late Wednesday calling for a federal probe based on McCarthy\u2019s remark.\n\u201cDana Rohrabacher\u2019s devout support of and advocacy for Russia\u2019s brutal regime is widely known, and given the ongoing investigation of Trump\u2019s possible collusion with Russia in the 2016 election along with Rohrabacher\u2019s deep ties to Trump, it\u2019s become abundantly clear that this spider web of ties must be investigated,\u201d Rouda said.\nEd O\u2019Keefe and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.",
