  "text": "Republicans\u2019 long-held dreams of tweaking Medicaid, repealing Obamacare and overhauling the tax code appear in more jeopardy than ever as scandal and investigations beset President Donald Trump's White House.\nSome Republicans fear that subpoenas and congressional inquiries will swamp the time they need to pass a health care or tax bill in 2017 \u2014 not to mention renegotiate NAFTA, unify behind a $1 trillion infrastructure plan or build that border wall.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cEverything affects our work right now. The more controversy we have the more difficult it is to do things,\u201d said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). \u201cBut this place is filled with controversy, so if you don\u2019t understand that, you\u2019re in the wrong job.\u201d\nThe Dow fell by more than 370 points on Wednesday, the largest drop since Trump took office, reflecting investors\u2019 fears about the news out of Washington. That plunge was followed by the Justice Department's decision to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate alleged Russian involvement in the presidential election \u2014 just the latest in a series of furors involving ties between Trump's campaign and Russia.\nIt\u2019s not just Republicans\u2019 policy agenda on the line but the party\u2019s own political future. Republicans control the White House and Congress and need to show they can govern, rather than just oppose, major policy packages. Many conservatives supported Trump precisely for that reason \u2014 the chance to enact a sweeping agenda. If that opportunity falls away as the White House\u2019s credibility erodes, so too could Trump\u2019s support among lawmakers, establishment Republicans and even his loyal base of voters.\n\u201cWhat has swayed a lot of mainstream conservatives is the possibility that we could do dramatic conservative reform on issues we care about,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, former policy director for the Romney-Ryan presidential campaign of 2012. \u201cThe ability to advance a conservative agenda they care about is a big reason why people skeptical of Trump have hung in there.\u201d\nRepublican lawmakers and Trump supporters say they\u2019re still determined to push through policy wins before the 2018 midterms \u2014 with or without the president\u2019s high-profile help. They have had a handful of early victories, including Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and the rollback of Obama-era regulations through the formerly little-used Congressional Review Act.\nBut the congressional calendar is tight, with long recesses in June and August. Floor time will be consumed by the passage of spending bills and action on the debt-ceiling limit this fall, not to mention the ongoing confirmation of Trump\u2019s political appointees. Congress has only so much bandwidth \u2014 and now investigations related to Trump's campaign and Russia will be taking up a share.\n\u201cThere are all kinds of questions about hearing time and floor time, if the investigations get more serious and that gets in the way,\u201d said Tevi Troy, a former domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThe mantra of any administration is that you have limited amount of time to get stuff done, and you need to keep pushing to get things done.\u201d\nLawmakers seem prepared for a go-it-alone strategy, as the Senate writes its own version of the health care bill and the House tax writing committee begins its first hearing on tax reform on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s just something we\u2019d have to confront,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \"Would it be a lot easier to do this if other things weren\u2019t ongoing? Of course. We\u2019re just going to have to deal with what we have before us.\"\nThe problem with this approach, however, is that even a totally Republican-controlled Congress needs a president to help close a deal. That was certainly the case with the health care legislation that the House narrowly passed this month. In the final hours before the bill passed the House, earning just one more vote than the 216 it needed, Trump had to make several phone calls to win over nervous GOP lawmakers such as Michigan Rep. Fred Upton.\nSome Republicans wonder whether Trump will be able to play that role effectively for future votes.\n\u201cEvery piece of significant legislation gets to a point where it requires the president to deliver the votes for his or her party. I have a real doubt as to whether this administration can deliver the last four to five votes,\u201d said one former Senate Republican leadership aide. \u201cThe margin for error is practically nothing and requires the administration to have some juice on the Hill to get anything done.\u201d\nFor the second week in a row, Senate Republicans have ignored the rising scandal and controversy at their daily lunches, which have been completely devoted to health care. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) briefly mentioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s upcoming briefing with senators on Thursday, but other than that there was no discussion of the matter, senators said.\nRepublicans want to show some independence from Trump and figure that continuing the work on legislation, despite the chaotic White House, will underscore their serious efforts at legislating.\nYet the president\u2019s unpopularity with the broader electorate and penchant for controversy could make it harder to move legislation later this year, several senators acknowledged. One of the chief concerns is that if and when a health care deal emerges, damaging revelations from Trump\u2019s White House could make it impossible to get across the finish line.\n\u201cThe bigger question is when we do get something that we think we could pass, what\u2019s the political backdrop when we try to do it,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\nThe same concerns could also hinder longer-term policy goals such as an infrastructure proposal or renegotiation of the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said this week that the administration will \u201cshare its vision\u201d by the end of May for Trump's still-unreleased infrastructure package, leaving Congress to fill in the blanks with legislation later in the year. But while rebuilding the nation's roads and bridges once seemed a fruitful area for Trump to build buy-in from Democrats, the multiplying questions about the president's actions make a kumbaya moment less likely.\nTrump and Comey: What's next?

You can unsubscribe at any time.\nAs for trade, experts doubt that Canada and Mexico will be motivated to pursue talks in August \u2014 the earliest they can formally begin \u2014 with any seriousness if Trump's troubles worsen. That's especially true given Mexico's elections next year and the fact that neither country wanted to redo NAFTA in the first place.\nEven without the investigations and the threat of subpoenas, the White House has already fallen behind its policy agenda of quickly passing health care and tax overhauls through reconciliation and then moving onto other agenda items.\n\u201cAll of the predictions of productivity for the year were predicated on the assumption that Trump could bring the GOP together,\u201d said one Republican lobbyist. \u201cThat assumption has proven faulty so far. The outlook will get even more grim if, instead of being a unifier, Trump becomes a liability. You\u2019re seeing some disturbing signs that this is where this thing is headed.\u201d\nTo the doubters and naysayers who argue that Republicans cannot work on domestic policy and handle incoming investigations, Trump supporters say: Just wait and see.\n\u201cThere is a tendency with the Beltway crowd, when there is a headwind, to count him out,\u201d said David Tamasi, the former Washington, D.C., finance chairman of Trump Victory. \"Whoever has made that bet in the past has not done well.\"\nKathryn A.
