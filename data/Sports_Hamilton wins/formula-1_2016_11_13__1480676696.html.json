That much is evident from the formidable resolve he has displayed so far in Sao Paulo, in leading two of the three practice sessions and then unleashing a late burst of brilliance to out-qualify his German rival by one tenth of a second. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have honestly felt quite comfortable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNico has been going quicker and quicker, but I have had it covered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\nPrepare, then, for a captivating drag race to the first corner. Rosberg, conscious of Hamilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s susceptibilities off the start line this season, intends to give ferocious chase, desperate as he is to make the pass that would propel him towards a maiden first world title. A win, as he is only too well aware, would be enough to claim the prize. Anything less, and he would risk the tussle with Hamilton rolling on to Abu Dhabi in a fortnight.\nThe worry for Rosberg is that Hamilton is the man with momentum. Buoyed by consecutive victories in the United States and Mexico, the three-time world champion is acting as if he would regard the loss of his status to Rosberg, a demonstrably slower driver, as an affront. His title prospects were damaged by mid-season engineering issues out of his control, and he is so fixated on making up the lost ground that he appears to believe his legend depends on it.\nRosberg was ebullient enough about making the front row, refusing to represent his shading by Hamilton as a setback. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very grim view of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am still optimistic for the race. I was missing a little on my last lap, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try to get Lewis into Turn One.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2", "downloadDate": "2016-12-02 11:04:56", "publish_date": "2016-11-14 10:37:08", "year":2016, "month":11,"day":14, "hour":10, "min":37,"author": "['Oliver', 'Brown', 'Victoria Monk', 'Chief Sports Feature Writer', 'Mick Cleary', 'David Coulthard', 'Tom Cary']", "pageTitle": "Lewis Hamilton masters drenched chaos in Brazil to set up desert showdown", "rss_title": "NULL", "descendant": false}
